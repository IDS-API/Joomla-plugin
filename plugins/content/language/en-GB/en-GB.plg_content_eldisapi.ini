ELDIS_API_DESC						= "<h3>To use the plugin, you must obtain a unique Token-GUID or key for the API. Please register for your API key <a href="http://api.ids.ac.uk/accounts/register/">here</a>. Once obtained, enter this key into the <em>API Token-GUID or key</em> section of the plugin parameters on the right hand side.</h3>The IDS KS API plugin allows access to IDS Knowledge Services content of thematically organised and hand selected academic research on poverty reduction in the developing world that is freely available to access online.<br /><br />The plug in allows the administrator to select content from either <a href="http://www.eldis.org" target="_blank">Eldis</a> or <a href="http://www.bridge.ids.ac.uk" target="_blank">BRIDGE</a>, and import each document as new articles into the site. Once set up, this plugin will automatically bring in new content to your site whenever it is added to the Eldis or BRIDGE websites.<br /><br />The plug in allows you to select:<ul><li>Whether you want Eldis or BRIDGE documents</li><li>The number of documents to import</li><li>The date range of when the documents were imported</li><li>The year of publication</li><li>The name of the author</li><li>The name of the publisher</li><li>The country/ies that the document focuses on</li><li>Any keywords assigned to the document</li><li>Any number of themes that are associated with the document - "top level" or parent themes are highlighted in grey</li></ul>So, if you were the administrator of a website that highlighted recent research on ICTs and Gender in Kenya, you would be able to select specific criteria to suit your content. You would select the themes <strong>ICT</strong> and <strong>Gender</strong>, as well as the country <strong>Kenya</strong> and could also filter these results by a specific <strong>date range</strong> or <strong>publication date</strong>.<br /><br />Themes (or topics) are added where relevant to all documents in the collection. These are arranged in a hierarchical structure and the "top level" themes are highlighted in grey in the theme selection drop down box.<h4>Tips for searching</h4>Although the Eldis and BRIDGE datasets are very wide ranging, very specific search terms may not return the number of results that you expect or want. Therefore, if you are not getting the results you expect, it might be worth trying more generic search terms or even simply searching at the Theme level.<br /><br />Please note: You can add multiple selections for the <strong>Theme</strong> and <strong>Country</strong> fields. The search then looks for results that contain either <strong>Theme</strong> or <strong>Country</strong>. <br /><br />e.g. A multiple selection of "India" and "Bangladesh" would show any results for:<br /><br /><em>either "India" OR "Bangladesh"</em><br /><br />All other fields are combined in the search, so only results that contain ALL fields are returned.<br /><br />e.g. A selection of "World Bank" as the publisher, "2010" as the year of publication, and a multiple selection of "India" and "Bangladesh" would show any results for:<br /><br /><em>World Bank AND 2010 AND (India OR Bangladesh)</em><br /><br /><strong>For terms and condition for using API see <a target='blank' href='http://api.ids.ac.uk/about/terms/'>here</a></strong>"
